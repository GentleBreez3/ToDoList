# ToDoList

## Install the following:

1. Node.js
2. NPM
3. MongoDB
4. Any Editor

## How to use:

The purpose of this Todolist is to have a unique and private Todolist for everyone without any need to have authentication procedure.
To use the todolist, use the listening port defined inside the project app.js (localhost:3000). This will take you to the home page of the app which will have a default todolist.The app is designed to create your own personal Todolist at different pages all together.


<b> Example </b>- Suppose you want to create a todolist for your some activity, you can simply go to your browser and create something like <em>"localhost:3000/yourActivity-yourName"</em> (e.g My name is Rambo and i want a todolist for gym, so i can simply create one by typing <em>"localhost:3000/gym-rambo"</em>) and it will create a todolist at that designated url for only me to use.
This is completely private to you since only you know the correct url pathing that you used to create your list. You can access it anytime and modify your list as you want.
